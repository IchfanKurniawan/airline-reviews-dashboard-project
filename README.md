### Project Context  
From point of view of airlines management, reviews from customers are crucial to improve their services & growth. Better service means more customer & more profit will be obtained. In addition, from point of view of customers, reviews from others are helpful to choose which airlines are perfect in their preferences, like in term of budget, seat, and other facilities.  

This project tried to fill the gap by collecting reviews & presenting it in dashboard that could be explored further by airlines management or customers.
